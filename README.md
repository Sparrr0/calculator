Overview:
This calculator app allows users to calculate various properties of 2D and 3D shapes. Users can input a number from 1 to 8 to select a shape and perform specific calculations related to that shape. The program supports calculations for area, perimeter, diagonals, circumferences, diameter, volume, and surface area for a total of 8 shapes.

Features:
Calculate properties of 2D shapes: circle, square, rectangle, triangle
Calculate properties of 3D shapes: sphere, cube, rectangular prism, cylinder
Input a number from 1 to 8 to choose a shape
Input a number corresponding to each calculation or input 0 to perform all calculations at once
Input 9 to exit the calculator
Concepts Used:
Loops: Utilized a while loop to prompt the user for input until a valid number is entered. Additionally, a loop through a string of alphabets is used to check if the input is a number.

Static Methods: Employed static methods for input validation and to perform calculations for specific shapes. This enhances code organization and readability.

Conditional Statements (if, else if, else): Used conditional statements to track user input, determine the selected shape, and print out the corresponding calculations. If statements are used for specific shape selection, else if statements are used to handle different calculations for each shape, and else statements are used for error checking.

Location of Key Concepts in Code:
Loops: Located in ShapeCalculator class at lines 32 and 268.
Static Methods: Implemented in ShapeCalculator class at lines 263, 282, and 315.
Conditional Statements: Found in ShapeCalculator class at lines 61, 284, and 291.
Usage:
Run the program.
Input a number from 1 to 8 to choose a shape.
Input a number corresponding to a specific calculation (or 0 to perform all calculations at once).
Repeat steps 2-3 as desired.
Input 9 to exit the calculator.
Conclusion:
This calculator app provides a user-friendly interface for calculating properties of various shapes. It demonstrates key programming concepts such as loops, static methods, and conditional statements. By allowing users to perform calculations efficiently and accurately, this app contributes to mathematical learning and problem-solving skills.
